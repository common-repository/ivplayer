IV Player is an interactive video player, if you are a teacher/educator/guru who wants to provide video content to your students/learners, then IV Player is the right choice.

== Description ==
IV Player not only loads video content but also text, images, files, code in real-time while watching the video. Just imagine how cool it would be if your learners/students would be able to grab code from the video player while you are teaching remotely


Once you have installed the plugin, 
1. You will see an option in the side menu saying `IV Player`. Click on it.
2. Then click on the `ADD NEW` button on the page. 
3. Then you will see a page asking details for your first Video to play.
4. Once you have filled minimum details like `URL`, `name` then add the timings.
5. While filling the timings, you need to specify at which time duration what needs to be played on screen. For example, you can choose `00:00:10` and  `hello` in the `Text` box. That means at `00:00:10` time point, you will see `hello` being played on the video player screen.
6.  Currently, we have `Text`, `Code`, `File`, `Link` boxes ready.
7. Once the video is created, a `shortcode` will be seen on screen. You can paste it in any `post` or `page`.


== Installation ==
1. You can install the plugin by searching in the plugins section of the WordPress admin.
